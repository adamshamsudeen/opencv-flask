#Opencv-Flask
Opelask (name subject to change) is an application written in Python to modify images in a fun and creative way by allowing you to add an image on top of another one to create banners like those found on Facebook.

The Python scripts overlays the given image with the other given image - the overlay image - to produce a third image which is the final banner like image. 

The application has a simple UI to go along with the script. The repo has all that you need along with the template UI HTML file.
